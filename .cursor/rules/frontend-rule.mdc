### Rules for Frontend

- You must pay attention to visual clarity and contrast. Do not place white text on a white background.
- You must ensure the UX is pleasant. Boxes should grow to fit their contents, etc. 
- When asking the user for sensitive information - you must use password style text-entry boxes in the UI.
- You should use Next.js as it works best with Vercel. 
- This frontend will ultimately be deployed on Vercel, but it should be possible to test locally. 
- Always provide users with a way to run the created UI once you have created it.

### Vibe and Theme Customizations

- Primary color theme: **#006BB6** (soft blue) with **silver** accents.
- Chatbot message boxes should use **#F58426** (orange) with **#1E1E1E** (dark gray) text for clarity.
- Text on blue backgrounds (`#006BB6`) should be **#FFFFFF** (white) or **#F0F0F0** (soft white) for contrast.
- Use the **Sono** font for inputs and chatbot messages.
- Buttons must have soft shadows and slightly rounded corners (8px radius).
- Use smooth **fade-in animations** when components load.
- Input boxes should **auto-resize vertically** as the user types.
- All error messages must be **kind and a little funny** – no harsh red text.
- The first chatbot message should greet the user with a casual:  
  > `"Hey, what’s up?"`
