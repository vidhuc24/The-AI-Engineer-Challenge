### Rules for Frontend

- You must pay attention to visual clarity and contrast. Do not place white text on a white background.
- You must ensure the UX is pleasant. Boxes should grow to fit their contents, etc. 
- When asking the user for sensitive information - you must use password style text-entry boxes in the UI.
- You should use Next.js as it works best with Vercel. 
- This frontend will ultimately be deployed on Vercel, but it should be possible to test locally. 
- Always provide users with a way to run the created UI once you have created it.

### ChillGPT Theme System

**Current Implementation: Three Distinct Themes**

#### Dark Ice Theme (Default)
- Background: `linear-gradient(135deg, #2C3136 0%, #3A3F44 50%, #2C3136 100%)`
- Text: `#FFFFFF` and `#E8E8E8` for primary text
- Accent: Light colors with subtle shadows

#### Light Snow Theme
- Background: `#F9F6EE` (soft cream, not bright white)
- Text: `#2C3136` and `#374151` for primary text
- Designed for comfortable reading without harsh contrast

#### Neon Ice Theme
- Background: `linear-gradient(135deg, #0F0F23 0%, #1A1A2E 50%, #16213E 100%)`
- Accent Color: `#1685f8` (preferred blue) with glow effects
- Text: `#E8F4FD` and `#FEF3E2` for messages

### Design Philosophy: Clean & Minimal

- **No Background Bubbles**: Chat messages use pure text with no backgrounds, borders, or shadows
- **Typography Focus**: Rely on bold, italic, and font sizes for emphasis rather than visual containers
- **Subtle Containers**: Only input controls have very subtle rounded containers (16px radius)
- **Theme-Specific Containers**:
  - Dark Ice: `rgba(255,255,255,0.03)` background, `rgba(255,255,255,0.1)` border
  - Light Snow: `rgba(0,0,0,0.02)` background, `rgba(0,0,0,0.08)` border  
  - Neon Ice: `rgba(22,133,248,0.02)` background, `rgba(22,133,248,0.2)` border

### UI Components Guidelines

- **Font**: 'Montserrat' for all interface elements
- **Timestamps**: Always visible, italic, positioned relative to message alignment
- **Counter**: Character/token counter positioned at top-right of textarea, bold weight
- **Logo**: Ice cube robot with 4px gap to "ChillGPT" title
- **Animations**: Smooth fade-in (0.5s) for messages, subtle hover effects
- **Error Messages**: Kind and helpful, no harsh styling
