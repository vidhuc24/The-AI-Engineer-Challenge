# ChillGPT Enhancement Experiments

This folder contains experiments for integrating advanced AI capabilities from the bootcamp course materials into ChillGPT.

## 🎯 Planned Enhancements

### Phase 1: Advanced Prompt Engineering
- **Source**: `01_Prompt Engineering and Prototyping Best Practices/`
- **Goal**: Enhance ChillGPT's personality system with advanced prompting techniques
- **Features**: 
  - Multi-turn conversation optimization
  - Context window management
  - Dynamic prompt adaptation

### Phase 2: Conversational Memory (RAG)
- **Source**: `02_Embeddings_and_RAG/`
- **Goal**: Add conversation memory and context awareness
- **Features**:
  - Chat history embeddings
  - Semantic search over past conversations
  - Context-aware responses

### Phase 3: Knowledge Integration
- **Source**: `03_End-to-End_RAG/`
- **Goal**: Make ChillGPT knowledge-aware about specific domains
- **Features**:
  - Document ingestion pipeline
  - Knowledge base integration
  - Fact-based responses

### Phase 4: Production Optimization
- **Source**: `04_Production_RAG/`
- **Goal**: Scale ChillGPT for production use
- **Features**:
  - Performance optimization
  - Evaluation metrics
  - Monitoring and logging
